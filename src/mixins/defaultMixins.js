      "This was an interesting and really exciting project as i was able to redesign and rebuild two main mobile Client and Admin Applications.\
          The project initially started off by solving the existing bugs so as to have a working system,\
          this involed reading 12000 lines of decoupled code. Time being of essence it took longer, hence the team from Greensoko requested I rebuild the whole system.\
          Pure excitement, for me as it focused on native and crossplatform applications, my passion.\
          The platform main focus was a retail store for food based products with an interesting model. \
          Started of with the UI/UX design of the platforms. Starting of with Low-level design, i focused purely on \
          functionality, hence had to make a design that only displayed the functions of the app. I used Balsamiq cloud tool, to do the design and shared it to the Greensoko team\
          for approval. Once approved i progressed to the High level design of the platform, this bit involved adding 'life' ot the design \
          through color,icons and afew illustrations. For the Hogh-Level design i used Figma tool and sent the designs once more to the Greensoko team. \
          Once approved i proceeded to creating my development environments i.e. Android Studio and Version Control (Github). \
          Development, I broke down the project in smaller 'chunks', activityPages, and greated a github private account that was acvessible to the Greensoko team and under the projects section\
          were able to see progress of each stage till completion and testing.\
          With this project i was able to build two mobile applications , Client Application that allowed customers to do their shopping, i build using Flutter technology\
          following best practice and for the Admin application that allowed the Greensoko team to manage orders, and manipulate their digital inventory\
          i built using Native Java. For the two mobile applications I used a MVM architecture and shared preferences in saving some states.\
          Once interesting challenge i faced was swicthing from Java to Dart and back to Dart while fixing bugs, their syntax are different, hence everytime i swicthed felt\
          as though i was swicthing my Calculus lesson from English to French and back, pretty fun.\
          I appreciate the team from Greensoko as they contributed to my growth as a developer. Thank you team Greensoko!\
