           challenging situations.This has trnsalted to furthur grow my ability to learn while still \
           gradually developing my meticoulous nature. This has helped me learn technologies over shorter periods of time,\
           learn and try understand why we are the way they we are and our true drivers in every ecospace we humans live and go.  \
